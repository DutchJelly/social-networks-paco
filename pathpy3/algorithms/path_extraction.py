    Calculates path statistics in a directed acyclic graph.
    All paths between all roots (nodes with zero indegree)
    and all leafs (nodes with zero outdegree) are generated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dag: DAG
        the directed acyclic graph instance for which paths are calculated
    node_mapping: dict
        can be a simple mapping (1-to-1) or a 1-to-many (a dict with sets as values)
    max_subpath_length: int
        This can be used to limit the calculation of sub path statistics to a given
        maximum length. This is useful, as the statistics of sub paths of length k
        are only needed to fit a higher-order model with order k. Hence, if we know
        that the model selection is limited to a given maximum order K, we can safely
        set the maximum sub path length to K. By default, sub paths of any length
        will be calculated. Note that, independent of the sub path calculation
        longest path of any length will be considered in the likelihood calculation!
    repetitions: bool
        whether or not to remove repeated nodes in paths. Repeated nodes can occur
        if a non-injective node_mapping is applied. If set to True, a path a,a,b,b,c,c,d is
        returned as a,b,c,d.
    unique: bool
        whether or not multiple identical mapped paths should be counted separately. For
        DAG representations of temporal networks with delta > 1, where nodes are temporal copies,
        we do not want to count multiple paths from the same root that pass through different
        temporal copies of the same physical node. For instance with delta=2, time-stamped edges
        (a,b;1), (b,c;3) are transformed into a DAG a1->b2, a1->b3, b3->c4. With the mapping to
        physical nodes we would find two different paths a->b->c of length two, which only differ
        in terms of WHEN they arrive in node c

) -> PathCollection:
    """
    Calculates the frequency of causal paths in a temporal network assuming a
    maximum temporal distance of delta between consecutive
    time-stamped links on a path. This method first creates a directed and acyclic
    time-unfolded graph based on the given parameter delta. This directed acyclic
    graph is used to calculate all time-respecting paths for a given delta.
    I.e., for time-stamped links (a,b,1), (b,c,5), (b,d,7) and delta = 5 the
    time-respecting path (a,b,c) will be found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tempnet : pathpy.TemporalNetwork
        TemporalNetwork to extract the time-respecting paths from
    delta : int
        Indicates the maximum temporal distance up to which time-stamped
        links will be considered to contribute to a causal path.
        For (u,v;3) and (v,w;7) a causal path (u,v,w) is generated
        for 0 < delta <= 4, while no causal path is generated for
        delta > 4. Every time-stamped edge is a causal path of
        length one. Default value is 1.
    max_subpath_length : int
        Can be used to limit the calculation of sub path statistics to a given
        maximum length. This is useful as statistics of sub paths of length k
        are only needed to fit higher-order model with order k and larger. If model
        selection is limited to a maximum order K, we can set the maximum sub path length
        to K. Default is None, which means all subpaths are calculated.

    Returns
    -------
    Paths
        An instance of the class Paths, which can be used to generate higher- and multi-order
        models of causal paths in temporal networks.
